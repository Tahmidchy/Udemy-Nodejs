    <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.<br> 
        Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
         when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.<br>
          It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.<br>
           It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages,<br> 
           and more recently with desktop publishing software </p><br>
